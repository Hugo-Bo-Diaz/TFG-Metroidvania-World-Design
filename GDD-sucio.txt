and were left to protect the purity of the elements, because of their mind they got angry with each other because of the weaknesses
of each element and the balance was lost
The player: is just an observer, appears after time the dungeon has fallen because he was frozen from imbalance or smth

wind protector: can't be reasoned with, has to be chased. is scared and wants to hide
grass protector: can't be reasoned with, is assertive and patient 
ground protector: can be reasoned with
